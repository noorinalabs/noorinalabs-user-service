# Apply the noorinalabs-user-service default-branch protection ruleset.
#
# Phase-3 end-state criterion #4 (noorinalabs-main#322): CI failures block all
# merges on every repo's default branch, enforced server-side by GitHub (not
# only by the Hook 4 comment-gate). This script is the OWNER/ADMIN-gated apply
# step: it POSTs (or, if a same-named ruleset already exists, PUT-updates) the
# canonical ruleset committed alongside it (ruleset-main.json).
#
# Why this is a post-merge, owner-run step — not done in the PR:
#   Creating/updating a repository ruleset requires repo-admin permission, which
#   the agent gh principal (parametrization) does not hold for this purpose, and
#   applying default-branch protection while a wave-branch PR is in flight can
#   block our own merges. So the durable PR artifact is the SPEC + this script;
#   the owner runs it from a window with no in-flight default-branch merge
#   (post-wave-wrapup is the safe window), then read-back-verifies.
#
# Design notes (see SPEC.md in this directory + charter pull-requests.md
# § Org-Wide Branch Protection):
#   * required_approving_review_count: 0 — GitHub's "require approvals" counts
#     FORMAL PR reviews, which our team structurally cannot produce (the gh auth
#     principal IS the PR author, so a formal self-approval 422s). Reviewer-count
#     enforcement stays with Hook 4 (validate_pr_review). A "require 1 approval"
#     rule would deadlock every merge.
#   * Required status checks: user-service has unconditional PR CI, so the
#     ruleset hard-requires its gate contexts (job NAMES, not workflow names):
#     `check` and `openapi-snapshot-drift`. Confirm them against live check-runs
#     at apply time (`gh api repos/<repo>/commits/<default-sha>/check-runs`) —
#     CI job names can change. `precommit-ci-sync` is an additional unconditional
#     gate added in W14; add `{ "context": "precommit-ci-sync" }` to the required
#     set once it has reported at least once on the default branch.
#   * Repository-admin always-bypass (actor_id 5) keeps the orchestrator's
#     --admin wave→main wrapup merges + the charter single-reviewer/doc-sweep/
#     emergency exceptions working. The hook-side ADMIN_MERGE_EXCEPTION gate
#     (validate_pr_ci_status) audits every such bypass.
#
# Usage:
#   ./apply-ruleset.sh                 # apply to noorinalabs/noorinalabs-user-service
#   REPO=owner/name ./apply-ruleset.sh # override target repo (for re-use)
#   DRY_RUN=1 ./apply-ruleset.sh       # print the payload + planned action, no write
